Thus the ECS application is a relatively generic mass scale internet based questionnaire solution that is configured to fulfil the specific DoS requirements. The configuration data has the following elements: \u2022 Census Page Definition \u2013 is an XML file that specifies the overall information for the Navigation panel, and the set of pages that make up the census, and various overall parameters such as the core application button labels (Next, Previous etc.). The census form is composed of multiple sections with questions; each section requires one or more pages to respond to the questions. \u2022 Census Form Definition \u2013 is an XML file that specifies each of the questions belonging to a section. This includes the question response type (Text, Date, Address and Selection), the question text, alternate question text, help text, labels, field sizes, field validation rules, question dependency rules, business rules, and all other presentation and functional aspects of each question on the form.

A more efficient approach is to develop a rich ECS client separate from the thin ECS client. The rich AJAX client application runs within the browser and generates all of the HTML pages displayed to the respondent based on definition data, locally. The respondent interacts with the displayed pages and the client performs all field and business rule validations, collecting the respondent and management information within the browser memory. The client application posts the collected respondent and management information to the server at each form completion point and when the respondent submits their data, or creates feedback or a technical help request.

Thus the ECS application is a relatively generic mass scale internet based questionnaire solution that is configured to fulfil the specific DoS requirements. The configuration data has the following elements: \u2022 Census Page Definition \u2013 is an XML file that specifies the overall information for the Navigation panel, and the set of pages that make up the census, and various overall parameters such as the core application button labels (Next, Previous etc.). The census form is composed of multiple sections with questions; each section requires one or more pages to respond to the questions. \u2022 Census Form Definition \u2013 is an XML file that specifies each of the questions belonging to a section. This includes the question response type (Text, Date, Address and Selection), the question text, alternate question text, help text, labels, field sizes, field validation rules, question dependency rules, business rules, and all other presentation and functional aspects of each question on the form.

A more efficient approach is to develop a rich ECS client separate from the thin ECS client. The rich AJAX client application runs within the browser and generates all of the HTML pages displayed to the respondent based on definition data, locally. The respondent interacts with the displayed pages and the client performs all field and business rule validations, collecting the respondent and management information within the browser memory. The client application posts the collected respondent and management information to the server at each form completion point and when the respondent submits their data, or creates feedback or a technical help request.
